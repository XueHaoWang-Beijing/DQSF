# Depth Quality-aware Selective Saliency Fusion for RGB-D Image Salient Object Detection

This is a Caffe implementation of our TIP 2019 paper.
## Prerequisites
1. [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe)  
2. [CUDA10](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)  
3. [CUDNN7.5](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/cudnn-install/)  
4. [Matlab2016b](https://www.mathworks.com/)
## Usage
1. Clone this code by `<git clone https://github.com/XueHaoWang-Beijing/DQSF.git --recursive>`, assume your source code directory is `<DQSF>`
2. Calculate our proposed depth quality-aware features.
